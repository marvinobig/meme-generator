## What I've learned
1. How would you describe the concept of "state"?
State is an object or variable that is able to be changed (mutated) by the component unlike props. It is also managed by the component internally like a variable declared within a function in vanilla javascript.


2. When would you want to use props instead of state?
When you don't expect the data a component is recieving to change according to the user's input or actions.

Immutable is when a variable or object in javascript is not able to be changed. Props in react are immutable and state is not immutable.
